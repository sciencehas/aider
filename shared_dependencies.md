Shared Dependencies:

1. Packages: The packages such as transformers and sentence-transformers are shared across all the files as they are required for the model, tokenizer, data processing, training, testing, and deployment.

2. Model: The model "TheBloke/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GGML" is shared across the main, model, train, test, and deploy files. It is used to load the model, train it, test it, and deploy it.

3. Tokenizer: The tokenizer associated with the model is shared across the main, tokenizer, data_processing, train, test, and deploy files. It is used to tokenize the input data, process it, train the model, test it, and deploy it.

4. Data Processing Functions: The data processing functions are shared across the main, data_processing, train, and test files. They are used to process the input data for training and testing the model.

5. Training Loop: The training loop is shared between the main, train, and test files. It is used to train the model and test it.

6. Test Loop: The test loop is shared between the main and test files. It is used to test the model.

7. Deployment Code: The deployment code is shared between the main and deploy files. It is used to deploy the model.

8. Requirements File: The requirements file is shared with all other files as it contains the necessary packages to be installed for the application to run.

Note: The exact names of the shared functions, variables, and data schemas will depend on the specific implementation of the code.
